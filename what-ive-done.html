                    <h3>Operations Strategy & Process Optimization</h3>
                    <p>
                        I specialize in identifying bottlenecks within complex data and logistical pipelines. During my tenure with Google Geo, I collaborated with SPMs and Product Managers to overhaul the oblique imagery ingest pipeline. By redesigning the post-flight arrival evaluation process and restructuring the data pipeline to prioritize viable imagery, I eliminated critical delays. This optimization, achieved in partnership with NovAtel, increased the velocity, volume, and quality of imagery data by 25%, significantly accelerating the public launch of imagery on Google Maps and Earth.

                    <h3>Large-Scale E-Commerce & Logistics</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have a proven track record of leading end-to-end operational scaling for national programs. As a lead for Google Express (GSX) and Google Shopping, I established the organization's first reverse logistics team, creating standardized SOPs and procurement practices from the ground up. I managed high-level strategic partnerships, including the execution of Statements of Work (SOWs) for a national packaging partnership with DURO. Additionally, I developed the deployment standards for GSX's cellular assets, ensuring all store operations met strict corporate security policies.

                    <h3>Regional Expansion & Growth</h3>
                    <p>
                        In 2016, I spearheaded the South Eastern expansion of Google Express. This involved relocating to Atlanta, GA, to oversee the launch of product coverage for an additional 250 million users. My role required a balance of high-level project management and "boots on the ground" operational execution to ensure a seamless rollout in a new, massive market.

                    <h3>Early-Stage Autonomous Technology</h3>
                    <p>
                        My foundation in emerging technology began at Project Chauffeur (now Waymo). As a Vehicle Tester and Mapping Operations Specialist, I worked at the earliest stages of autonomous vehicle development. This role required extreme attention to detail and a deep understanding of how real-world data is captured and translated into the digital maps that power self-driving systems.

                    <h3>Creative Production & Technical Integration</h3>
                    <p>
                        My recent professional focus has returned to the creative production space. Operating in this fast-paced environment has sharpened my ability to solve immediate logistical problems and maintain rigid project schedules under intense pressure. I am currently bridging this creative experience with advanced technical training in Cloud Technology (AWS Certified, 2025) and AI/LLM frameworks, focusing on how these tools will define the next generation of operational scaling.
